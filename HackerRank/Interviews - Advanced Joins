/* problem
Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. 
Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, 
and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are.
Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds  screening contest.

The following tables hold interview data:
Contests: The contest_id is the id of the contest, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the contest, and name is the name of the hacker. 
Colleges: The college_id is the id of the college, and contest_id is the id of the contest that Samantha used to screen the candidates. 
Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge that belongs to one of the contests whose contest_id Samantha forgot, and college_id is the id of the college where the challenge was given to candidates. 
View_Stats: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, total_views is the number of times the challenge was viewed by candidates, and total_unique_views is the number of times the challenge was viewed by unique candidates. 
Submission_Stats: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, total_submissions is the number of submissions for the challenge, and total_accepted_submission is the number of submissions that achieved full scores.
